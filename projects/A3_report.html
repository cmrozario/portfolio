			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I've seen this type of population pyramid before and wanted to apply it to my question of if we have an underpopulation problem.
					I wanted to see if the US's population pyramid has become "top heavy" in 2000 compared to in 1900. I compare the two years by overlaying the 
					population pyramids for the two years on top of eachother.
				</li>
				<li>This chart will do a good job highlighting the differences between the two years but has a couple of issues. I am unnessesarily showing gender breakdown.
					I have to add extra labeling to highlight the age groups. The colors will be tricky; they got really muddy in the sketch.
				</li>
				<li> In the next sketch I want to loose some of the extra information and see how I can narrow the information I present to only answer the question I am asking.
				</li>
			</ul>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I have heard and read about potential underpopulation issues western countries may be facing and wanted to visualize the population
					breakdown of the United States and how it has changed in the past 100 years. 
				</li>
				<li>The main question of "Do we have a population grown problem?" is answered in this chart by looking at the slopes of the three lines relative to eachother. 
					However, I don't really care about population growth and it would be difficult for a reader to tell what the point of my graph is, how it answers my question, and requires work to 
					extract the info I want them to extract. 
					
				</li>
				<li>In the next sketch, I will try to show the relative changes of the age composition more efficienlty and as the main focus of the graph.
		 </li>
			</ul>

				<figcaption>
					Bar chart of population age composition for 1900 and 2000.

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>This graph gets at the core of the question and help visualize the relative changes in population composition better. I want to know if we are facing an overpopulation issue and if there are too many 
					social security aged people (62 and older) and not enough working aged people paying taxes to fund the pool of social security money needed. 
				</li>
				<li>This design removes the emphasis of the irrelavent data from the previous graph (population growth), but it is stil shown and slightly distrcting.
					Another thing to note is that the actual social security cutoff happen in the 
					middle of on eof the buckets and cannot be properly split. This is a fault of the binned data and not something I can account for. 
	
				</li>
				<li>In the next sketch I want to visualize the breakdown of the population more in relative terms. This sketch shows it in an absolute way 
					that lacks context.
				</li>
			</ul>

 

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        The first sketch allowed me to take a loose idea I had and formulate a specific question I wanted to answer. It encoded unnessesary gender information and would require a good amount of annotation. 
		However, I do like that I am putting a new twist on a familiar chart concept. 
		The second chart really narrows down on the crucial information but the answer to my question is in the difference of the 
		slopes of the lines which is a little convoluded and may take the reader a while to put together.
		The third does a better job highlighting the percent changes but still encodes the population growth which I would rather not show. 
		I will explore whether to bucket the ages into groups or show them all along with annotating the groups.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
		To answer my question, I wanted to visualize two things: the magnitude of the working class versus the senior class, how these magnitudes 
		have changed in the past 100 years. Throughout phase 1, I found it was simple to put this information into a visualization, but not simple 
		to put JUST this information in the visualization. The first main issue I had to solve was: I did not want to convolve my visualization with 
		population growth data. I do not care about how the population has grown, I only care about its makeup. To do this, I decided to show the 
		breakdown in percentages of the total population for each year instead of using absolute numbers. However, there were some tradeoffs here. 
		</p>
		<p>
		My first instinct was a pie chart. This looked nice and conveyed what I wanted it to, but in class, Prof. Arvind said never to use pie charts 
		as they are interpreted differently by each person. So I came up with the bar chart. Then, I remembered the discussion on how humans can't tell relative 
		magnitudes of bars if they are not aligned on the same axis. So I thought about aligning the three bars on the vertical axis instead. However, this 
		looses the encoded information that these are percent breakdowns of the total population. The reader wouldn't be able to tell that the three stacked bars, 
		when layed out end to end, measured the same length and were not encoding magnitude of population. 
			
		</p>
		<p>
			I chose to add the percent increase labels to solidify the answer to the main question. I didn't want the reader to have to work to look at the graph then 
			estimate their own answer. I chose the color scheme I did becuase I wanted it to be light on your eyes but still have alot of contrast. Hence the muted 
			primary colors. I chose to group the ages into three buckets; child, working, and senior. To answer my question, you need to aggregate over these fields 
			and I wanted to save the reader the mental math of summing over many bars of the same color. This coarse bucketing obscures specific age population data 
			but that is by design.

		The insights of what did and didn't work were the main tools I used to design this visualizaiton. 
		Phase 1 helped me decide what was really necessary and be creative with ideas I couldn't necessarily come up with in Tableau.
		In Assignment 2 when we were mass-producing visualizations, I was exploring ideas and options in Tableau itself. This meant I 
		was limited to what I knew how to do in the application. During phase 1 of this assignment, I wasn't designing with Tableau in mind,
		I was allowed to be as creative as I wanted to be. This creativity is what led me to this question of overpopulation which I found very interesting to try 
		to answer with this dataset.
